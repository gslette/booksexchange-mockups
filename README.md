# booksexchange-mockups
The mockups I created in Sketch for our team semester-long project in IT484. 

Titled Books Exchange, the idea was to create a simple, easy to use site, similar to Craigslist, but for textbooks. Finding used textbooks can be a bit of a pain, and as a student I've often found that the book store or online sites offer incredibly low buyback prices. By creating a site where students can buy and sell directly to each other, we hoped to put money back in sellers pockets, as well as allow buyers to find textbooks cheaper than they would on other online sites.
